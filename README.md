The To-Do List project is a user-friendly and interactive web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project offers an efficient way to organize daily tasks by providing essential features and a visually appealing interface.

Key Features:

Add Task: Users can add new tasks through an input field and a dedicated "Add Task" button. Each task is displayed in a list format for easy management.
View Tasks: All tasks are displayed dynamically in an organized manner, making it simple to track pending and completed activities.
Mark Task Complete: Users can mark tasks as complete with a single click, which updates the task's appearance (e.g., strikethrough text).
Delete Task: Each task comes with a delete button, enabling users to remove specific tasks from the list.
Delete All Tasks: A dedicated "Delete All Tasks" button clears the entire list with one click, providing a quick reset option.
Filter Options: Users can filter tasks based on their status:
"All" to view every task,
"Complete" to show only completed tasks,
"Incomplete" to display tasks that are yet to be finished.
Local Storage Integration: Tasks are saved in the browserâ€™s local storage, ensuring that data is retained even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Provides the structure and layout for the application.
CSS: Ensures a responsive and visually appealing design, with support for different screen sizes.
JavaScript: Handles the dynamic functionality, such as adding, deleting, filtering tasks, and interacting with local storage.
